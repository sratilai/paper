Just some new Ideas!!
======================

I could quite decide where to put these, so I created a new file into the project folder.

Once I had all written down I 

1. pulled all the possible changes from Saaras github repos for paper by `git pull` (nothing had changed)
2. added it locally to git repository by typing `git add some_new_ideas.md` (staging area at this stage)
3. then I committed the changes into repository by `git commit -m "a got some new ideas and created new file"`
4. finally I typed `git push` to push my changes (a new file) into Github
