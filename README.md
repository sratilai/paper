# Russian string bag (this is a metaphorical prelude to the essay)

The Russian string bag is called avoska.

## An example

## Use of avoska


I would like to write a short article/ essay on our digicoffee initiative to be published in some academic journal. Hopefully, this project turns from the hopeful but often too empty avoska bag (see above) into the dynamic and empowering movement of ripaska dancing (see below).

# Diginotes
Here below are my notes from ASEEES conference, which took place in Boston Nov 21-24, 2013. This can be used as the basis for our essay. What other topics there could be?
## Topics
1. What is digital humanities (DH) ?
2. The "filter bubble" and other interesting concepts
3. Ongoing projects

### 1. Defining digital humanities

Digital humanities can be defined in, at least, three different ways: 1) as computational methods in humanities research; 2) as studies in new media; and 3) as IT solutions for humanities, which often refers to e-learning, online collaboration etc.

Some traces of "digital humanities understanding" of culture and literature can also be found  in the studies conducted already in the analogical age. These are, for example:

A. Markov's article on Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, written in 1913, in which he applies his statistic analytical tool known as the "Markov chain"
- [Brian Hayes: First Links in the Markov Chain](http://www.americanscientist.org/libraries/documents/201321152149545-2013-03Hayes.pdf)

and Vladimir Propp's classical study *The Morphology of the Folktale* from 1928.

### 2. Understanding the digital turn

As we use search engines in order to find useful data/knowledge, our search result is based on an algorithm. Google, for example, uses personally customized algorithm for each user. It is interesting what Matthew Kirschenbaum writes about database- and algorithm-based organization of knowledge and more on this could be added here (reference missing). On the negative side, customization of search results is said to lead to a situation in which, we all live in our own filter bubbles deluded and alone (wording needs to be changed). This seems to be the argument in Eli Pariser's book *The Filter Bubble* (2011).
